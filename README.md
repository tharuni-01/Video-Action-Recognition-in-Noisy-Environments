# Video-Action-Recognition-in-Noisy-Environments
Video action recognition is essential in various fields such as surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. However, accurately identifying actions in noisy environments poses significant challenges due to factors like video degradation and interference. Elements such as visual noise, background clutter, motion artifacts, and low-light conditions can degrade video quality, impacting the accuracy of traditional recognition systems.

This project aims to address these challenges by leveraging advanced techniques and technologies. We utilize the Mediapipe framework, renowned for its robustness in multimedia processing, and integrate it with the high-performing video classification model Movienet. Our focus is on implementing advanced noise reduction and robust action recognition methods, including:

Spatial and Temporal Filtering: To reduce noise and enhance the clarity of video frames.
Adaptive Algorithms: For dynamically adjusting to varying video quality conditions.
